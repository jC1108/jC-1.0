#### Can We See It?

As you know, I am attempting to create my own website. The site you see here is built using "Jekyll" and the GitHub theme "Type on Strap". Thanks to their developers! Honestly, I don't know if this site will run smoothly, but I've done my best. Maybe in the future, when I have enough coding knowledge (and English, and maybe even German), I will present a better website for myself and anyone who wants to see it.

 如您所知，我正在尝试制作自己的网站。你在这里看到的网站是基于 "Jekyll "和GitHub的主题 "Type on Strap "建立的。感谢他们的开发人员！
 老实说，我不知道这个网站能否顺利运行。不过，我已经尽力了。
 也许在将来，当我有足够的编码知识（和英语（也许还有德语））时，我会为我自己和所有想看到它的人展示一个更好的网站。
