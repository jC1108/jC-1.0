Hi!

It've been a long time since the last time I updated.

Hope you're still interested in it.

Let me think what can I share now...

Last year (2023) I started studying Deutsch (German for "German"), and got a 99/100 in my  German 1 Class. Wonderbar!!!

My eye and dental problems are still getting worse. So I plan to drink less soft drinks and eat less sweets.

Hope everyone is always healthy.

<br>
  
And, 

Happy New Year to all!
