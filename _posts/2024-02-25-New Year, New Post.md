Hi!

It's been a while since my last update. I hope you're still interested in what I've been up to.

Let's see what I can share now...

Last year (2023), I started studying Deutsch (German for "German") and scored 99/100 in my German 1 class. Wonderbar!

Unfortunately, my eye and dental problems are still worsening, so I plan to cut back on soft drinks and sweets.

Wishing everyone good health!




<br>
  
And, 

Happy New Year to all!
