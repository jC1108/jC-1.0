Welcome! Here is jC's personal website. 

I've had the idea of creating a website that belongs to me since last year (around Oct., 2022) dued to some funny ideas I had while chatting with my mother. At the end of 2022 I had tried to make my website based on other website building platforms, I tried two but both failed. Then I had a specific dream (or it can be described as an "aim") of having such a website at the begaining this year (around Jan.4, 2023). And in July, 2023, with the help of GitHub["https://github.com/"] and Jekyll["http://jekyllthemes.org/page18/"], I started building my website, which is the one we see now. 

The website is incomplete currently;

  "  There’s a million things I haven’t done,

     but just you wait, just you wait... " 
     ("Hamilton"["https://open.spotify.com/track/4TTV7EcfroSLWzXRY6gLv6?si=81324bcccaaf4aba&nd=1"]). 

Thanks for your vist and reading!

Sincerely,

jC.
